# Stock-Trend-Forecasting

STOCK TREND FORECASTING

OVERVIEW
This project focuses on predicting future stock price trends using Machine Learning algorithms and data visualization techniques.
The primary objective is to analyze historical market data, identify meaningful patterns, and forecast future trends to assist in data-driven financial decisions.

KEY FEATURES

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

Machine Learning Models – Implemented regression and time-series models for prediction.

Trend Visualization – Interactive plots for price movement and prediction comparison.

Model Evaluation – RMSE, MAPE, and accuracy metrics to measure model performance.

End-to-End Workflow – From data ingestion to visualization in one streamlined pipeline.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Git & GitHub

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/vedprakash8721/Stock-Trend-Forecasting.git

Navigate to the project folder:
cd Stock-Trend-Forecasting

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the notebook or script to start training and prediction.

RESULTS

Achieved strong prediction consistency across multiple stock datasets.

Demonstrated visual comparison between actual vs predicted price trends.

Proved effective for short-term stock movement forecasting.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Integrate LSTM / Deep Learning models for sequential predictions.

Add real-time API integration for live market data.

Deploy as a web application using Streamlit or Flask.

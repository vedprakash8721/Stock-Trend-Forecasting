# Stock Trend Forecasting: Machine Learning for Market Prediction

## üìà Overview: Predicting Financial Trends

This project delivers an end-to-end solution for predicting future stock price trends. It leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** algorithms and robust data visualization to transform raw historical market data into **actionable financial insights**.

The primary objective is to **analyze complex time-series data**, identify hidden market patterns, and provide reliable, data-driven forecasts to assist in short-term trading and decision-making.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Details

* **Robust Data Pipeline:** Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning, including **handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling** for optimal model input.
* **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of classic **Regression** (e.g., Linear Regression, SVR) and **Time-Series Models** (e.g., ARIMA/Prophet) for trend prediction.
* **Advanced Visualization:** Creation of interactive plots using **Plotly** and **Matplotlib** for clear visualization of price movement, trend analysis, and **actual-vs-predicted price comparison**.
* **Model Validation:** Rigorous performance evaluation using industry-standard metrics: **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**, and prediction accuracy.
* **Streamlined Workflow:** A documented, cohesive pipeline covering everything from data ingestion and model training to final results visualization.
